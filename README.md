# Py-Lingo

A personal project to automate the process of getting updates related to my duolingo account.
Could be used to get the data of some other user, although that would have limitations without password access.
## NOTE: This is a "personal" project created solely for "personal" usage. So use it on "personal" risk.  

## Current Status?
Currently this working is dead cause duolingo recently updated their way of logging in. This needs some changes regarding the latest updates made in their login process.

### What Then?
Some tinkering can be done regarding the current way that duolingo team is trying to avoid bots. Will have to find a way to bypass that.
